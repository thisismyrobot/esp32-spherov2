# ESP32 Sphero V2 controller

Connecting to and controlling a Sphero V2 (SPP Bluetooth Classic) from an
ESP32 running Arduino requires a special combination of ESP32 board software
(1.0.2) and the replacement of the BluetoothSerial code.

This repo is a working Arduino project example of connecting to and moving a
Sphero 2.0.

There won't be further development here, this is just to get the code out
there after many hours of debugging.

This wouldn't have been possible without this comment, thank you:
